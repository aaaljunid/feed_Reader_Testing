# Udacity Feed Reader Testing

This is project #4 of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. In this project, I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It is designed to make sure various functions and aspects of the application work and behave as expected. The goal is to learn about JavaScript testing, which is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD.


## How to Run the Application

1. You can download or clone this repository.

2. Find the `index.html` file, and open the file in a modern browser, such as Chrome or Firefox.
